# Requirements_Backupinator
A quick and easy way to handle a mangled packages environment.

This is a quick and easy method I found online for cleaning up your environment. In case you install a bunch of things (as I did) and can't seem to find a way to cleanly remove it. Since it backs up the current environment you're able to rollback changes, but I suspect there's a chance of issues.

***Use at your own risk***
